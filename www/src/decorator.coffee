# The decorator pattern
# ---------------------
#
# > Creates pluggable filters to process common services in a standard manner 
# without requiring changes to core request processing code. The filters intercept 
# incoming requests and outgoing responses, allowing preprocessing and post-processing. 
# We are able to add and remove these filters unobtrusively, without requiring 
# changes to our existing code. ---[Intercepting Filter](http://java.sun.com/blueprints/corej2eepatterns/Patterns/InterceptingFilter.html)

  # The ConcreteComponent is the object that gets decorated. For example, 
  # you want an object that represents a request (think PHP's $_REQUEST). 
  # Unfortunately Javascript doesn't have an object like that so we create
  # an empty request object that will get decorated with all the params from
  # the querystring. That empty request object is the ConcreteComponent.
